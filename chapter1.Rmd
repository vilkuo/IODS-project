# Week 1 - About the project

*I'm feeling exited to get started with the course assignments. I hope to learn new techniques to visualize and analyze the data I produce.*

*The Exercise Set was a good introduction to R. I didn't feel like both the textbook and the exercise file were super necessary because, most of the time, for me it was enough to read the textbook. I mostly did not deepen my understanding on the subject by running the code myself since the code output was already written on the textbook.*

*My favorite topics were the ones that were the most difficult also. I liked trying to understand the flow of the code in the data summarising chapter where the different functions worked together.*
